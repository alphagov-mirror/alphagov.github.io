    <h1>Government Digital Service</h1>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> is a unit of the UK's
      Cabinet Office tasked with delivering digital by default. We have a practice of
      <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/">Coding In The Open</a>,
      which means that a lot of public repositories end up on
      <a href="https://github.com/alphagov">our GitHub account</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://alpha.gov.uk/">Alpha.gov.uk</a> was the proof of concept that demonstrated
      that the GOV.UK project (and the Government Digital Service with it) could work.
      It was launched in May 2011 and remained live until the beta of GOV.UK launched
      at the end of January 2012. This GitHub account was set up for that project and
      then became the main account for the Government Digital Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      As well as this account, we use the
      <a href="https://gds-attic.github.io/">GDS attic GitHub account</a> to store
      repositories that we've used but no longer maintain.

          Iterate over all alphagov repos each time we try to output a repo.
          We do this because there's no way to select an element from an array with Liquid.
